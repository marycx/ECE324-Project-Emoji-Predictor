# ECE324-Project-Emoji-Predictor
Goal: Address the question of how to use machine learning to build a model that predicts the most suitable emoji to go along the given block of text. The model will output three top predicted emojis for the users to choose from.


Where to Look:
1. upload_data_preprocess.ipynb contains the code for raw data preprocessing

2. upload_BERT_model.ipynb contains the code for BERT model implementation

3. upload_baseline_model.ipynb contains the code for the baseline model implementation

4. The folder 'Data' contains the raw data and preprocessed data:
   1) raw dataset: dataset_twitter-scraper.csv
   2) data_preproc_csv_50(2): contains 16200 data entries with encoded emojis
   3) data_preproc_emoji_50(2): contains 16200 data entries with actual emojis
   4) emoji_to_number_ref_50: contains the reference between each emoji to its encoded number
  
5. Final_Report_ECE324_EmojiPredictor-1.pdf is the final report
