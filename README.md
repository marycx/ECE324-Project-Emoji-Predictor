# ECE324-Project-Emoji-Predictor
Goal: Address the question of how to use machine learning to build a model that predicts the most suitable emoji to go along the given block of text. The model will output three top predicted emojis for the users to choose from.


Where to Look:
1. upload_data_preprocess.ipynb contains the code for raw data preprocessing.
2. upload_BERT_model.ipynb contains the code for BERT model implementation.
3. upload_baseline_model.ipynb contains the code for the baseline model implementation.
